## Design Overview
The project's design will prioritize clarity and simplicity. The user interface will be divided into two main sections: the countdown timer and the stopwatch. Each section will include input fields for setting time durations and buttons for control. The countdown timer will display the remaining time dynamically, while the stopwatch will show the elapsed time. Stylistic choices will include a modern font, appropriate spacing, and clear button labels for optimal usability.

## JavaScript Functionality
JavaScript will play a crucial role in providing the functionality of the Timer and Stopwatch project. Key JavaScript functions will include:
